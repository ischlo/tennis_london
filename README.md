Tennis courts in London
================

# Intro

This repo holds the code for the web map that shows the tennis courts in
London from OpenStreetMap. It relies on the great
[leaflet](https://leafletjs.com) library and the
[geokdbush](https://github.com/mourner/geokdbush) extension for fast
search of nearest points. Both are made possible by Volodymyr Agafonkin,

#### Blog post

I dedicated a blog post on my website to explain the process of getting
this data from OSM, processing it in R and plotting it on the web. Look
at [this link]() for more.
